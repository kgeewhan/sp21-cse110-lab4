# Part 3. Debugging using the DevTools
1. The bug was that `num1` and `num2` were both strings so that when we added the two numbers together, we would only get a concatenated version of them.
2. I fixed the bug by using `parseInt()` on both of the num variables in order to make their dataypes of the type Integer.
